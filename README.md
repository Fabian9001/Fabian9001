Hello there, I'm Fabian.

I just created my Github account and I'd love to find a first project I can contribute to as a Github newbie!

I'm currently working on on little scrabble game, written in Lua. Ultimately, I want to move it to LÃ¶ve.

Scripting / programming languages I know:
  - Lua
  - C
